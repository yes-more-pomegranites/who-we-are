# Breif Introduction <br>
I (quisaw) made this because I got bored, and wanted to use Github more.<br>
This group is for me and my friends to make things.<br>
I want my friends to learn HTML and a bit of CSS if they don't already.<br>
I am going to learn LUA and make some dumb things.<br>
I don't know what everyone else will learn, so I will update this as often as possible with the latest info.
